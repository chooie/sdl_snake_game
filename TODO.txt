TODO

/ Move box around with keyboard
/ Make game consistent across window sizes
    / Scale to window 
    / Scale to canvas that conforms to fixed aspect ratio
/ Draw multiple shapes onto canvas
/ Separate simulation and render steps to work at different rates
    - I.e. fixed simulation step with any frame rate on the render
/ Draw text
    x If I want to use actual fonts I probably have to use OpenGL?
    x Simplest solution would be to draw boxes that look like letters (like the pong tutorial I did)
    / I can use SDL_ttf apparently, too
/ Render some debug text (e.g. fps, cpu cycles/frame)
    ? Render multiple debug texts in a column (millis/frame, fps, actual megacyles/frame, budgeted megacycles/frame,
      actual/budgeted - i.e. percent utilization)
    ? Can toggle the debug text on and off
? Make a game prototype
    e.g. Snake
? Play sound

Nice-to-haves
--------------
? Controller support
? Rebindable keys

Cleanup/Best-practice
-------
? Get rid of all the duplicate SDL2 includes

Notes
-----
Game feels a lot smoother when I choose an FPS that is either my refresh rate or some clean multiple of it (e.g. 1/2).
Turns out I shouldn't have been using 60 FPS if my monitor was at 165hz - dangggggggggggggggggg. How am I only figuring
this out now!? That's why Braid had such weird target FPS values like 88.4FPS. I've switched to 60 FPS and am now
targeting 59.9 FPS.
