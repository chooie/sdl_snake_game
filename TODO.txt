/ Move box around with keyboard
/ Make game consistent across window sizes
    / Scale to window 
    / Scale to canvas that conforms to fixed aspect ratio
/ Draw multiple shapes onto canvas
/ Separate simulation and render steps to work at different rates
    - I.e. fixed simulation step with any frame rate on the render
/ Draw text
    x If I want to use actual fonts I probably have to use OpenGL?
    x Simplest solution would be to draw boxes that look like letters (like the pong tutorial I did)
    / I can use SDL_ttf apparently, too
/ Render some debug text (e.g. fps, cpu cycles/frame)
    / Render multiple debug texts in a column (millis/frame, fps, actual megacyles/frame, budgeted megacycles/frame,
      actual/budgeted - i.e. percent utilization)
    / Can toggle the debug text on and off
/ Make a Snake game prototype
    / Constantly move in whatever direction player is facing
    / Draw player grid
        - If you crash into the screen edge, you die
    / Player is one grid block
    / Player moves one square at a time
    / Queue multiple user inputs so we don't drop any
    / Draw a blip
    / The snake can grow another square behind it
    / The snake grows another square behind it when it hits the blip
    / Blips can be eaten which then triggers the next one to spawn randomly
    / Track length as score
    / Optimize text rendering
        / Cache font loading
        / Cache texture until value changes?
            - Did this for the score
    / Optimize drawing the grid
    / Optimize debug text rendering
    / Colliding with wall or self restarts the game
        / Show Game over message
        / Can restart the game
    / Start speeding up as more blips are eaten
/ Play sound
/ Game menu
    / Show game paused when I pause
    / Game intro screen
        - State: Game Screen | Gameplay
        - Game Screen:
            - Snake Game
            - Start Game
            - Exit

Nice-to-haves
--------------
? Controller support
? Add 'grace period' when colliding with wall or self
    - The user should have a chance of like 1 second or so where they can turn to save themselves
? Rebindable keys
? Volume controls
? FPS controls

Cleanup/Best-practice
-------
/ HOW DO I STOP RE-RENDERING TEXTURES EVERY FRAME
    - THIS IS CAUSING MISSED FRAMES AND GENERALLY THROWING OFF THE TIMING
    - I can use a bitmap
    - I can just re-render textures for dynamic text and cache the static text textures
? Get rid of all the duplicate SDL2 includes

Notes
-----
Game feels a lot smoother when I choose an FPS that is either my refresh rate or some clean multiple of it (e.g. 1/2).
Turns out I shouldn't have been using 60 FPS if my monitor was at 165hz - dangggggggggggggggggg. How am I only figuring
this out now!? That's why Braid had such weird target FPS values like 88.4FPS. I've switched to 60 FPS and am now
targeting 59.9 FPS.
