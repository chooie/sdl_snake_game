TODO

/ Move box around with keyboard
/ Make game consistent across window sizes
    / Scale to window 
    / Scale to canvas that conforms to fixed aspect ratio
/ Draw multiple shapes onto canvas
/ Separate simulation and render steps to work at different rates
    - I.e. fixed simulation step with any frame rate on the render
? Draw text
    - If I want to use actual fonts I probably have to use OpenGL?
    - Simplest solution would be to draw boxes that look like letters (like the pong tutorial I did)
    - I can use SDL_ttf apparently, too
? Make a game prototype
    e.g. Snake
? Play sound




Nice-to-haves
--------------
? Controller support
? Rebindable keys
